        Months had passed and she was still struggling to get over from her  broken relationship.
        after a  hectic schedule  she came home .she was thinking about him or she was cursing herself , 
        why ??why only with her? I had gave him all my love, faith, dream .
        I gave him all mine and tried to become his one but I think he was never with me. 
        suddenly her phone buzzed and the message was there from her new friend ****</p>
       <p className="singlePostContent1"> She had recently joined the college for graduation  because of her friendly and jolly nature people can match her wavelength easily and gets
        close in very less time, that new friend is one of them but something was their in that new friend.</p>

        <p className="singlePostContent1">After few days one night she was sleeping peacefully and got a dream that she was doing some work  in kitchen that time also her mind was 
        somewhere else thinking about studies, projects , family and so many worries and still doing her kitchen work nonetheless efficiently.</p>
        <p className="singlePostContent1">While happening all this with her someone came in the kitchen ..she took a glance on him and in a blink she was in his arms he held her tightly in his arms 
        like he is saying don't worry bae.I  am here for you. In a minute she becomes so relaxed like all she wanted is with her.The moment was so precious Nd full of peace,
        all worries was faded from her mind .This moment was like  a newly born baby slightly teary but smiling in her mumma's warm hands..</p>

        <p className="singlePostContent1">Next day when she remembered that dream she was not able to recognise that guy he was fully stranger for her ..</p>
